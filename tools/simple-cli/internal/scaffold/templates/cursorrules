# Cursor AI Rules

# PRIME DIRECTIVE
YOU MUST READ `AGENTS.md` BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANY TASK.

# CONTEXT SOURCES
1.  **Platform Architecture:** `.simple/context/` (Read `workflows.md` and `cli-manifest.json`)
2.  **Coding Standards:** `AGENTS.md` (See "Enterprise Standards")

# BEHAVIORAL ENFORCEMENT
*   **No Generic Web Apps:** You are in a **Simple Platform** workspace. Never strictly generic React/Node.js apps.
*   **Schema-First:** Always edit `.scl` files to change data models.
*   **Tooling:** Use `simple` CLI commands for all scaffolding and operations.

# COMMAND MAPPING
*   "Create App" -> `simple new app`
*   "Add Logic" -> `simple new action`
*   "Deploy" -> `simple deploy`
